DESCRIPTION
-----------

### Fedora Digital Object

Fedora defines a generic digital object model called [Fedora Digital Object Model]. To create new digital objects in a 
Fedora Commons repository you might use the [Service APIs] or the [client command-line utilities]. However, creating a
digital object and providing it with datastreams usually involves several steps. ``easy-ingest`` lets you ingest complete
digital objects that have previously been staged on the client file system.
